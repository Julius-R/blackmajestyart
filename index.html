    <h2>About Me</h2>
       <h3>"The Hand Behind the Brush"</h3>
         <p>My name is Markeisha Shorter. I&#8217;m a twenty-three year old artist, born and raised in Louisiana. I started drawing and painting as a toddler, and it quickly became the biggest part of my life. Since then, I&#8217;ve dedicated my time to perfecting my craft, hoping to share my creations with art lovers around the globe. One day, I hope to be a graphic designer as well.  I believe that the world is filled with beauty, and I try to reflect that through my art. For me, this isn&#8217;t just a hobby. It&#8217;s what I love.</p>
